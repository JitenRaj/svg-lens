## 🔍 Overview

**SVG Lens** is a browser-based developer tool designed for zero-loss SVG inspection.

While most design tools add "junk" metadata or alter path coordinates upon export, SVG Lens extracts the **100% raw XML source** exactly as it exists in the file.

Whether you are debugging animations, auditing path data for web components, or ensuring your icons are production-ready, SVG Lens provides a clear view through the "lens" of raw code.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Zero-Loss Extraction:** No optimization, no minification, no altered coordinates. What you see is the exact original source.
* **Live Render Preview:** See your SVG rendered instantly on a high-contrast transparency grid.
* **Privacy-First Architecture:** Files are processed entirely in your browser. Your data never touches a server.
* **Developer Workflow:** * **Drag & Drop:** Quick upload interface.
* **One-Click Copy:** Fast clipboard extraction.
* **Instant Download:** Save local copies after inspection.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Use `[Delete]` to quickly clear the workspace.
